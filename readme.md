# susybaka-docs

This repository acts as a centralized documentation hub for all major open source projects of mine.

**Live site**: [https://docs.susybaka.dev](https://docs.susybaka.dev)

## Currently Hosted Projects

### FFXIV Raidsim
- Docs: [https://docs.susybaka.dev/raidsim](https://docs.susybaka.dev/raidsim)
- Source Code: [https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim)

## How It Works

Each project maintains its own documentation source (usually in a `/docs` folder). This repo automatically fetches, builds, and hosts them using GitHub Actions.

## Contributing
